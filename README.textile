h1. Clever Algorithms & JRubyArt Playground


Learning about evolutionary algorithms and visualising them in Processing, via JRubyArt.

h2. Install

Check the JRubyArt docs for latest install instructions. My merry dance was something like installing Java 8, JRuby then JRubyArt and adding some paths like so:

bc.
# JAVA
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8`
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin

bc.
# JRUBY
export PATH=/data/development/vendor/jruby-9.0.3.0/bin:$PATH

h2. Run

Once installed you can do something like this to fire up Processing and get a REPL.

bc.
k9 watch genetic-oo.rb

h2. Thanks
